# Privacy Policy — Modded in the Valley

**Effective date:** November 2, 2025  
**Owner:** Modded in the Valley — Wasilla, Alaska  

I operate Modded in the Valley as a sole proprietor based in Wasilla, Alaska.  
I provide console modification, repair, and customization services.  
This policy explains how I handle information you share through Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Discord, or other direct messaging and contact platforms — as well as by mail when sending in a device.

---

## 1. Information I Collect
I only collect the information needed to provide quotes, schedule work, and complete services.  
Depending on how you contact me, this may include:

- Your **display name or username** (Facebook, Reddit, Discord, etc.)  
- **ZIP code** (used to estimate service availability or mail-in options)  
- **Device details** (brand, model, and description of the issue or requested work)  
- **Optional photos or notes** you provide about your device  
- **Legal name and return address** if you choose mail-in service  

I do **not** request or store birthdays, payment card data, or other unnecessary personal details.

---

## 2. How I Use the Information
- To respond to your request or message  
- To provide quotes, updates, or instructions  
- To schedule and complete services or mail-in returns  
- To maintain basic records for communication and accounting  
- To follow up about work I’ve completed, when needed  

I never use this information for marketing or tracking outside of direct conversations you start.

---

## 3. Information Sharing
I do **not** sell, rent, or trade your information.  
Information may be shared only as necessary to:
- Communicate through third-party platforms (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, or Discord)  
- Ship or return devices through USPS or another carrier  
- Comply with lawful requests, if required by law  

Each platform you use (like Reddit or Discord) also has its own privacy policy which applies to your messages on their systems.

---

## 4. Data Retention
I keep basic service information — such as device type and repair notes — only as long as needed for record-keeping, accounting, or repeat customer reference.  
You can request that I delete conversation history or personal details at any time.

---

## 5. Security
I take reasonable precautions to keep service records private.  
However, communication on third-party platforms (Meta, Reddit, Discord, etc.) follows their own security and data practices, which I do not control.

---

## 6. Children’s Information
My services are for adults.  
I do not knowingly collect or store information from anyone under 13 years old.

---

## 7. Your Rights
You may:
- Ask what information I have about you  
- Request that I correct or delete your information  
- Withdraw consent for me to keep or use your information  

You can make requests through any contact method listed below.
