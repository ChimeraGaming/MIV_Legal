**Effective date:** November 2, 2025  
**Owner:** Modded in the Valley - Wasilla, Alaska  

I operate Modded in the Valley as a sole proprietor.  
By requesting a quote, messaging me, or submitting a service form, you agree to these terms.

## 1. Service Scope
All console modification, repair, or customization work is performed by me personally and only after your approval.  
Services may include hardware repairs, cosmetic mods, firmware or software work, or other requests discussed directly with you.

---

## 2. Customer Responsibility
- You confirm that you are the owner of the device or have permission from the owner to authorize service.  
- You agree to describe the device issue or requested work accurately before service begins.  
- You understand that console modifications or third-party repairs may **void manufacturer warranties**.  
- You agree to back up any personal data before service. I am **not responsible for data loss** during or after repairs or modifications.  

---

## 3. Liability
I take care in all work performed, but because every device and condition is different:
- I am **not responsible** for pre-existing damage, hidden faults, or hardware failures unrelated to the requested service.  
- I am **not liable** for damages exceeding the cost of the labor or service itself.  
- All work is provided **as-is**, with no expressed or implied warranty beyond what was discussed directly with you.

## 4. Parts and Materials
- In most cases, **you provide your own parts** for modifications or repairs.  
- If I source parts on your behalf, full payment for parts may be required upfront.  
- Parts are provided **without warranty** unless otherwise stated by the original manufacturer or seller.

---

## 5. Payment and Quotes
- All pricing and quotes are discussed in writing through Messenger, Discord, Reddit, or email.  
- Quotes are valid for 14 days unless otherwise stated.  
- Payment is due at pickup, drop-off, or before a mail-in device is returned.  
- I reserve the right to decline or cancel any service prior to work starting.

---

## 6. Mail-In Services
If you choose to mail in your device:
- You are responsible for safely packaging and shipping the device to me.  
- I am responsible for safely packaging and returning it once the agreed work is completed.  
- Return tracking is always provided, but I am **not responsible for shipping carrier delays or damage in transit**.

## 7. Communication
All communication may occur through Facebook, Reddit, Discord, or email.  
By messaging me, you consent to receive updates about your service through that platform.  
I do not use your contact information for marketing or unrelated messages.

## 8. Cancellations and Abandoned Devices
If you cancel before work begins, there is no charge.  
If you cancel after work starts, you may be responsible for partial labor costs.  
Devices left unclaimed for **30 days after completion** may be considered abandoned and used for parts or resale to recover costs.
