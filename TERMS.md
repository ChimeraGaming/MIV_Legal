**Effective date:** November 2, 2025

**Owner:** Modded in the Valley — Wasilla, Alaska  

I operate Modded in the Valley as a sole proprietor.  
By requesting a quote, messaging me directly, or submitting a service form, you agree to these terms.

---

## 1. Service Scope
All console modification, repair, or customization work is performed by me personally and only after your approval.  
Services may include hardware repairs, cosmetic mods, firmware or software work, or other requests discussed directly with you.

---

## 2. Customer Responsibility
- You confirm that you are the owner of the device or have permission from the owner to authorize service.  
- You agree to describe the device issue or requested work accurately before service begins.  
- Console modifications or third-party repairs may **void manufacturer warranties**.  
- You agree to back up any personal data before service. I am **not responsible for data loss** during or after repairs or modifications.  
- You are responsible for any digital content placed on your device. I do not provide or distribute copyrighted material.

---

## 3. Liability
I take care in all work performed, but because every device and condition is different:
- I am **not responsible** for pre-existing damage, hidden faults, or hardware failures unrelated to the requested service.  
- I am **not liable** for damages exceeding the cost of the labor or service itself.  
- All work is provided **as-is**, with no expressed or implied warranty beyond what was discussed directly with you.

---

## 4. Parts and Materials
- In most cases, **you provide your own parts** for modifications or repairs.  
- If I source parts on your behalf, full payment for those parts may be required upfront.  
- Parts are provided **without warranty** unless otherwise stated by the original manufacturer or seller.

---

## 5. Payment and Quotes
- All pricing and quotes are provided in writing through Messenger, Discord, Reddit, or email.  
- Quotes are valid for 14 days unless otherwise stated.  
- Payment is due at pickup, drop-off, or before a mail-in device is returned.  
- Once work has started, labor may be partially or fully non-refundable.  
- I reserve the right to decline or cancel any service prior to work starting.

---

## 6. Mail-In Services
If you choose to mail in your device:
- You are responsible for safely packaging and shipping the device to me.  
- I am responsible for safely packaging and returning it once the agreed work is completed.  
- Return tracking is always provided, but I am **not responsible for carrier delays, loss, or damage in transit**.

---

## 7. Communication
All communication may occur through Facebook, Reddit, Discord, or email.  
By messaging me first, you consent to receive service updates through that platform.  
Your contact information is only used for communication regarding your service request — **never marketing**.

---

## 8. Cancellations and Abandoned Devices
- If you cancel before work begins, there is no charge.  
- If you cancel after work begins, you may be responsible for partial labor costs.  
- Devices left unclaimed for **30 days after completion** may be considered abandoned and used for parts or resale to recover costs.

---

## 9. Direct Messaging Clause
If you choose to bypass the form and message me directly:
> **Direct messaging or providing a device implies acceptance of these Terms of Service.**

This protects both parties by ensuring the same expectations apply regardless of how service is initiated.

---

## 10. Policy Updates
These terms may be updated from time to time. The effective date and last updated date will always be shown at the top of this page.
